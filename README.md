# Seattle Library System & Goodreads Reporting 

This project is done as part of a university program for a data warehouse course. 

## Datesets
### Seattle Library Collection Inventory

### Seattle Library Checkouts by Title

### Goodreads Book Graph Dataset

The source includes a section for ETL (Jupyter Notebooks), and a streamlit app that was built as the presentation layer for the final reports.

The code wasn't initially meant to be shared, but if anyone is interested I could clean it up and provide proper documentation.
